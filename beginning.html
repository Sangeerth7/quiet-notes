    <h2>The Beginning 🌷</h2>

    <p>
      We knew each other for a long time.
      Almost two years of knowing names, faces, and small details… 
      without ever knowing that one ordinary day would quietly change everything 🤍 
    </p>

    <p>
       Somewhere between all that randomness, we became company.
       And that company felt easy — like something that 
       didn’t need effort, explanation, or pretending ✨

    </p>

    <p>
     We talked for a long time.
     About random things. 
     About nothing important. 
     Yet somehow, everything felt important✨
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s when I realised —  
      comfort like this isn’t common.  
      It doesn’t force itself.  
      It simply stays.
    </p>

    <p>
      And without knowing it,  
      this… became the beginning 🌙
