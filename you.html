    <h2>You,as you are! 🌷</h2>

    <p>
      You’re a caring person in a way that feels real.
Genuinely 🌷🤍 
    </p>

    <p>
      I see how much you enjoy being a nurse.
      The way you talk about it.
      The way you understand people.
      The way you care without trying to show it.

    </p>
<p>
    It makes me admire you more than I ever say out loud 🩺🤍 
</p>
    <p>
     You might be quiet with the world.
But with me, you open up in your own way.
And I notice everything — even the things you think go unseen. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Being close to you feels warm.
      Safe.
      Like I don’t have to be anyone else 🌼
