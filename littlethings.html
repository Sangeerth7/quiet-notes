<h2>Little Things I Love about you</h2>

<p>
<p>
Your dimples 😚😭  
They appear so suddenly,  
like they don’t even ask for permission.
<br><br>
And every single time,  
they catch me off guard and steal my heart a little more 💛
<br><br>
The way you say  
“yaa rabeee…”  
“ayshh…”  
“achodaa…”  
“mwuahhhh”
<br><br>
You probably don’t realize this…  
but these little sounds stay with me longer than you think.
<br><br>
They’re small things,  
but they feel personal —  
like pieces of you only I get to hear 🤍
