    <h2>That Look</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes when we kiss,  
      you stop.  
      <br><br>
      Not suddenly.  
      Just softly.
      <br><br>
      And you look into my eyes —  
      in that different way…  
      the kind that doesn’t need words 🤍
    </p>

    <p>
      In those moments, everything else disappears.  
      My thoughts slow down.  
      And it feels like my soul forgets where it belongs —
      <br><br>
      and finds its place right there, with you 🤍✨
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t know how you do that.  
      I just know I never want to forget that feeling.
      And iam always craving for the warmth from you
      🤍✨
